DBLab API (DLE API) is a REST API. It can be used in multiple ways:
- directly, using a common tool (e.g., [curl](https:/curl.se/), [HTTPie](https://httpie.io/)) or code (Rython, Go, Ruby, PHP, NodeJS, and virtually any language or framework that supports work with REST APIs)
- indirectly, in command-line environment: [DLE CLI](https://postgres.ai/docs/reference-guides/dblab-client-cli-reference) operates on top of the DLE API
- indirectly, in browser: [DLE UI](https://postgres.ai/docs/database-lab/user-interface), being a React application, speaks to the DLE API as well
