Recover accidentally deleted data

- In the case of manually deleted data that needs to be restored ASAP, it can be done almost instantly (proper snapshot management configuration is required in Database Lab in advance).
- Using thin cloning, the point-in-time recovery (PITR) can be performed without long waiting.
- Typically, for 1 TiB database, PITR requires more than 1 hour in classic setups. With Database Lab, it takes a few seconds to a few minutes.
