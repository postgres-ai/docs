## What is Database Lab?
Database Lab is used to boost software development via enabling ultra-fast provisioning of databases of any size. Developers, DBAs, and QA engineers work with full-sized independent clones of PostgreSQL databases. Development and testing tasks are accomplished much faster, with more iterations done, with better quality achieved and with much less money spent.

- Optimize non-production infrastructure costs by 10x.
- Drastically improve development quality.
- Get rid of downtimes and avoid performance degradation.
- Cut half of the TTM (time to market), develop 2x faster than competitors.
