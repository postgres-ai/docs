# Zero-downtime Postgres major upgrades

**`Physical2logical` + `PAUSE`/`RESUME`** technique for true zero-downtime, reversible, zero-data-loss Postgres major version upgrades. Battle-tested on mission-critical clusters with dozens of terabytes of data and 100,000s TPS.

## Three critical guarantees

Our solution delivers all three essential characteristics for enterprise-grade major upgrades for Postgres:

- **Zero downtime**
- **Reversible**
- **Zero data loss** (in both directions)

## The problem

Traditional Postgres major version upgrades require:

- **Hours of downtime for multi-terabyte databases** if you want to properly test things (otherwise, operations like `ANALYZE` can take significant time and are not automated)
- **Complete database shutdown** during `pg_upgrade`  
- **Irreversible process** — no easy way back if issues arise
- **Hard to test and verify** procedures for various issues like incompatibilities
- **Risks of plan flips** and performance regressions after upgrade

## Our solution: Four-component approach

A complete system:

- **Reliable, safe, battle-proven `physical2logical`** conversion technique for zero data loss
- **PgBouncer's `PAUSE`/`RESUME`** for true zero-downtime connection management
- **Reverse replication** enabling full reversibility — go back if needed with zero data loss
- **Extensive testing before deployment** including for plan flips and compatibility issues

## Case studies

- [GitLab's conference talks](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=gitlab+postgres+upgrade+conference) about their zero-downtime upgrade experience
- [pganalyze technical review](https://pganalyze.com/blog/5mins-postgres-zero-downtime-upgrades-logical-replication) of zero-downtime upgrade approaches including our method
- [Gadget's zero-downtime upgrade](https://gadget.dev/blog/zero-downtime-postgres-upgrades-using-logical-replication) of their core production database from Postgres 13 to 15
- More cases (TBD)
