# Realistic Test Environments

A single instance of the DBLab Engine can generate many
fully isolated database clones.  These clones can replace the need
to setup, maintain, and pay for standalone development and staging databases.
[Learn how the DBLab Engine works](/products/how-it-works).

## Your Staging Server Doesn't Give You the Full Picture

Most organizations take one of the following approaches to build a staging server:

1. Staging has its own data that has been generated internally over time.
1. Staging periodically restores a production backup and either
    1. leaves the data alone violating best practice
    1. wipes away most of the data leaving only a small percentage
    1. masks the data using homegrown tools

None of these approaches are ideal because they leave organizations with either
suboptimal testing environments or high development and maintenance costs.

## Find and Fix Bugs Earlier

The DBLab Engine resolves these limitations by providing instantaneous
access to full-size, [safely-masked](/products/data-masking) clones of production data.

Test (and even development) environments using clones generated by the DBLab Engine make it
vastly simpler for software teams to find and resolve bugs _before_ they hit production.

Examples of what teams can do with instantly available production clones:

1. Quickly reproduce an issue that surfaced on production without a lengthy setup
1. Easily reset a staging or development database while conducting pre-release testing
1. Preview _precisely_ how code and data changes will impact production prior to release


## Save Money _And_ Simplify Setup

A single instance of the DBLab Engine can generate many fully isolated database clones.
Allocating new clones is governed by role-based permissions and can easily be done either through
our web portal or command-line tool.

With Database Lab, software teams gain access to higher quality data for testing purposes
and can reduce the cost of their test environments.
