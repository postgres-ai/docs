# Mid-Market Customer Advisory Group

After years of work with large enterprises, we're investigating how Database Lab
can help mid-size software companies (15-100 engineers) improve the safety and
testability of their database changes.

We're recruiting a small number of companies to join a Customer Advisory Group
to help us tailor our product to their needs.  Group members will receive free
access to Database Lab for 6 months.

* The designated product champions will attend a monthly, 30-minute feedback session with our team.

## Why join?

* Gain all the benfits of Database Lab, including
  [automated database migration testing](/products/database-migration-testing),
  [seamless SQL optimization](/products/joe),
  and [realistic test environments](realistic-test-environments).
  Free for 6 months.
* Shape our product roadmap to the needs of your organization.
* _Added Bonus:_ We will run a free PostgreSQL Query Optimization Training course for your whole team based
  on the #1 voted talk from this year's [PGConf.Online](https://pgconf.ru/en/2021).
