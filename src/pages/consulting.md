# Consulting

<a href="mailto:consulting@posgtres.ai">Reach out to the Postgres.AI team</a> to solve your performance, scalability, and automation problems related to PostgreSQL.

We have worked with Postgres professionally since 2005 and have extensive experience in maintaining and optimizing heavily loaded systems.

How does Postgres.AI differ from other consulting companies?

- Strong focus on automation: manual operations don't scale. Everything needs to be automated: provisioning, backups, backup verification, failover, health checks, dev/test database refreshes, and answering basic DBA questions.
- Check 10 times, do once: full-fledged verification is a must for any changes related to databases.
- Help your team grow. We are not going to compete with your engineers. We are happy if your team expertise grows. Namely:
- We will build the special "Lab" environments for your developers and DBAs so they will be able to experiment, troubleshoot, and sometimes break databases without interfering with colleagues and not putting production databases in danger. This will drastically change the behavior and habits of engineers, allowing them to learn SQL and Postgres much faster, and build products of better quality while minimizing production issues.
- We will help you find good in-house DBAs. We will help them grow their knowledge (organizing training, sharing knowledge, and bringing the best experts in each particular area).
– Our customers especially point to the fact that when talking to us they always learn something new.
