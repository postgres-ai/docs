# Postgres consulting: complex problems, clear solutions

We love startups. And we're extremely passionate about Postgres, an awesome DBMS.

Over 5 years, we've helped dozens of startups master their PostgreSQL challenges. Two of them, GitLab (NASDAQ:GTLB) and Chewy (NYSE: CHWY), went through successful IPOs with our team helping them ensure Postgres clusters stayed reliable and performant as they scaled to many thousands of engineers and $10-20B market caps. We know how to help teams handle database growth with confidence.

## When to engage

You need us if you're a fast-growing startup on PostgreSQL (whether it's managed services like RDS or Supabase, or self-managed with or without Kubernetes), seeing good traction, but hitting database bottlenecks that your team or managed service provider struggles to solve efficiently. We step in to resolve these challenges and set you up for continued growth.

## Our approach

We break down complex database problems into clear, actionable steps. Through practical experimentation and early testing, your team learns to solve performance and scalability challenges quickly. No guesswork—just proven solutions based on real-world experience.

The professional support we get from Postgres AI is amazing, and the team is really to the point and deeply experienced in Postgres. We solved the problems we had when we started with the help of Postgres AI."

    <blockquote>
        "The expertise of Nik and team at Postgres AI has helped us significantly with the performance of our PostgreSQL database. Nik's understanding of PostgreSQL internals and ability to transfer his knowledge to us has helped prepare us for scale. Additionally, we use Row Level Security heavily, which is not a widely used feature. When we ran into some obscure performance issues with it, Nik was able to root cause it very quickly. This likely saved us weeks of time. Look forward to working with Postgres AI in the future."
