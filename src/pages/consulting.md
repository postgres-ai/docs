# Consulting

Talk to the Postgres.ai team to solve your performance, scalability and automation problems related to PostgreSQL.
We work with Postgres professionally since 2005 and have a lot  experience of maintaining and optimizing heavily loaded systems.

How does Postgres.ai differ from other consulting companies?
- Strong focus on automation: manual operations don't scale. Everything needs to be automated: provisioning, backups, backup verification, failover, healthchecks, dev/test database refreshes, answering basic DBA answers
- Check 10 times, do once: full-fledged verification is a must for any changes related to databases
- Help your team grow. We are not going to compete with your engineers. We are happy if your team expertise grows. Namely:
- We will build the special "Lab" environments for your developers and DBAs so they will be able to experiment, troubleshoot, sometimes break databases not interfering with colleagues and not putting production databases into danger. This will drastically change the behavior and habits of engineers, so they will learn SQL and Postgres much faster, and build products of better quality, while minimizing production issues.
- We will help you find good in-house DBAs. We will help them grow their knowledge (organizing trainings, sharing knowledge and bringing the best experts in each particular area)
– Our clients especially point to the fact that when talking to us they always learn something new.
