*This is Day 3 of [Postgres AI launch week](/launch-week)*

It starts innocently enough.

You choose Postgres – solid, reliable, battle-tested. You pick a managed service like RDS or CloudSQL. They handle backups, high availability, disaster recovery. You can focus on building your product. Life is good.

Your startup grows. Users love what you've built. Data accumulates – gigabytes become terabytes. Traffic surges – hundreds of requests become thousands per second.

Then one day, everything changes.

Queries that ran in milliseconds now take seconds. Connection pools max out during peak hours. Replication lag appears out of nowhere. Your perfectly fine database suddenly isn't fine at all.

You reach out to your managed service support. The response? A generic checklist. "Have you tried increasing your instance size?" Days pass. Your users complain. Your team scrambles. The support ticket remains open, unhelpful.

**This is when you realize: nobody cares about your database health as much as you do.**

**This is exactly when it's time to engage Postgres AI.**

For 5+ years, the Postgres AI team has been rescuing companies from exactly this situation. Our clients include GitLab, Miro, Chewy, Midjourney, ClickUp, Photoroom, Gamma, Suno, Supabase – they faced a lot of database challenges during hypergrowth.

Our approach: comprehensive health checks using a methodology refined over hundreds of engagements. We call it **Postgres AI Checkup** – it identifies current issues and predicts future ones before they cripple your business.

Last year alone, we conducted 30+ deep checkups for 20+ companies. Today, we're launching this as a scalable service, enhanced with AI automation while keeping human experts at the core.

## Beyond monitoring: comprehensive health checkups

While [postgres_ai monitoring](/blog/20250722-postgres-ai-v0-7-expert-level-postgresql-monitoring) (released yesterday) provides real-time metrics and dashboards, today's announcement goes further. Postgres AI Checkup service delivers monthly expert-led assessments with structured reports containing actionable recommendations and direct expert support – comprehensive health checkups that diagnose issues, provide expert analysis, and guide you toward resolution.

## What is Postgres AI Checkup service?

Monthly comprehensive health assessments of your Postgres databases, delivered by experts with AI assistance:

- **Monthly health checkup report** with Observations, Conclusions, and Recommendations
- **Two 30-minute expert calls** to discuss findings and guide implementation
- **Continuous health monitoring** via postgres_ai (our open-source tool)
- **Proactive issue detection** before problems impact your operations

## The human + AI approach

Pure AI-based analysis isn't reliable enough for production databases. We combine:
- **AI**: Pattern recognition, anomaly detection, initial analysis
- **Humans**: Context understanding, strategic recommendations, quality assurance

Every checkup includes direct involvement from our Postgres experts – ensuring quality and relevance for your specific context.

## When to use Postgres AI checkup

You're a startup experiencing explosive growth – maybe an AI company with usage going through the roof. Your small engineering team is focused on shipping features at breakneck speed. You're running Postgres on RDS or another managed service.

Everything was fine when you were small. But now you're at terabytes of data, handling thousands of transactions per second. Suddenly: slow queries, connection limits, replication lag, mysterious performance degradation. Your managed service support? Slow, generic, not particularly helpful.

**This is the perfect moment to engage Postgres AI.**

We've helped dozens of companies in exactly this situation. We know what it's like to scale fast and break things, but we also know how to fix them.

With Postgres AI Checkup service, you get:
- Experts who've seen your exact problems before at similar scale
- Fast, specific answers instead of generic support tickets
- Proactive guidance to prevent the next crisis
- A partner who understands startup urgency

**Don't wait for the next crisis:** **[Console.Postgres.ai](https://console.postgres.ai)**

## What each checkup covers

- Performance bottlenecks and query optimization
- Configuration tuning and index health
- Resource utilization and capacity planning
- Security, backup, and disaster recovery assessment
- Application-database interaction patterns

## What's coming next

We're actively developing automated query analysis reports, comprehensive customizable alerts with AI + human escalation, and predictive capabilities for capacity planning. All enhancements will be rolled out to subscribers at no additional cost.

## Getting started

Ready to ensure your Postgres databases are running at their best?

1. Sign up in [Console.Postgres.ai](https://console.postgres.ai)
2. There, create your organization
3. In organization's dashboard, choose "Set up Postgres AI Checkup"

<p align="center">

</p>

4. Next, you'll be guided to create a subscription, and set up postgres_ai monitoring (to be installed in your infrastructure – you'll need a Linux machine with Docker installed, then just set up using the snippet provided in Console)

That's it. Your first health checkup will be performed within the first week, then monthly thereafter.

## Pricing

**$500 per cluster per month** – one monthly deep checkup report with two expert calls.

- Comprehensive monthly health checkup with expert analysis
- Two 30-minute calls to discuss findings and implementation  
- Continuous health monitoring via postgres_ai (free, open source)
- No setup fees, cancel anytime

**What counts as "one cluster"?** Any single production Postgres environment – whether self-managed, RDS, Aurora, GCP CloudSQL, Supabase, or any other setup. Size doesn't matter, number of replicas doesn't matter. One production cluster = one subscription.
