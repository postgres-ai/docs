The Postgres.ai team is happy to announce the release of version 3.2 of [Database Lab Engine (DLE)](https://github.com/postgres-ai/database-lab), an open-source tool that provides blazing-fast database cloning and branching for any PostgreSQL database to build powerful development, test, QA, and staging environments.

Database Lab Engine is an open-source technology that enables thin cloning for PostgreSQL. Thin clones are exceptionally useful when you need to scale the development process. DLE can manage dozens of independent clones of your database on a single machine, so each engineer or automation process works with their own database provisioned in seconds without extra costs.
