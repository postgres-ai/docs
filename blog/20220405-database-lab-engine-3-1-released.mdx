<p>The Postgres.ai team is happy to announce the release of version 3.1 of <a href=\"https://github.com/postgres-ai/database-lab\">Database Lab Engine (DLE)</a>, the most advanced open-source software ever released that empowers development, testing, and troubleshooting environments for fast-growing projects. The use of Database Lab Engine 3.1 provides a competitive advantage to companies via implementing the \"Shift-left testing\" approach in software development.</p>

<p>Database Lab Engine is an open-source technology that enables thin cloning for PostgreSQL. Thin clones are exceptionally useful when you need to scale the development process. DLE can manage dozens of independent clones of your database on a single machine, so each engineer or automation process works with their own database provisioned in seconds without extra costs.</p>

<p>In this release, the development team has also focused on the Database Lab Engine community, making it easier to get help or contribute. The team greets all new contributors: <a href=\"https://gitlab.com/ndevxx\">@Nikolay Devxx</a>, <a href=\"https://gitlab.com/asotolongo\">@asotolongo</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/Tanya301\">@Tanya301</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/denis-boost\">@denis-boost</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/pietervincken\">@pietervincken</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/ane4ka\">@ane4ka</a></p>

<p>In DLE 3.1:</p>
<ul>
<li>Native support for pgBackRest as a tool to restore data from archives (physical mode, including continuously updated state), in addition to the existing support of WAL-G</li>
<li>Allow configuring timezone in DLE CLI configuration to improve the experience of using DLE in CI/CD pipelines</li>

The Postgres.ai team is happy to announce the release of version 3.1 of [Database Lab Engine (DLE)](https://github.com/postgres-ai/database-lab), the most advanced open-source software ever released that empowers development, testing, and troubleshooting environments for fast-growing projects. The use of Database Lab Engine 3.1 provides a competitive advantage to companies via implementing the "Shift-left testing" approach in software development.

Database Lab Engine is an open-source technology that enables thin cloning for PostgreSQL. Thin clones are exceptionally useful when you need to scale the development process. DLE can manage dozens of independent clones of your database on a single machine, so each engineer or automation process works with their own database provisioned in seconds without extra costs.

In this release, the development team has also focused on the Database Lab Engine community, making it easier to get help or contribute. The team greets all new contributors: [@Nikolay Devxx](https://gitlab.com/ndevxx), [@asotolongo](https://gitlab.com/asotolongo), [@Tanya301](https://github.com/Tanya301), [@denis-boost](https://github.com/denis-boost), [@pietervincken](https://github.com/pietervincken), [@ane4ka](https://github.com/ane4ka)

:::

In DLE 3.1:
- Native support for pgBackRest as a tool to restore data from archives (physical mode, including continuously updated state), in addition to the existing support of WAL-G
- Allow configuring timezone in DLE CLI configuration to improve the experience of using DLE in CI/CD pipelines
