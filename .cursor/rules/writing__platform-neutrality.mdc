# Platform neutrality

## Core principle

Maintain neutral, professional tone when discussing any database platform or service provider.

## Requirements

- **No criticism**: Avoid negative language about platforms like Supabase, AWS RDS, Google CloudSQL, or any other managed services
- **Focus on recommendations**: Present constructive solutions and workarounds for platform limitations
- **Objective analysis**: State facts about platform constraints without judgment
- **Solution-oriented**: Emphasize what can be done rather than what cannot be done

## Language guidelines

### Use (Professional, Neutral):
- "Platform constraints require alternative approaches"
- "This setting is not configurable on managed platforms"
- "Consider contacting support for this configuration"
- "Alternative solutions include..."
- "Platform-specific implementation requires..."

### Avoid (Critical, Negative):
- "Platform X doesn't support..."
- "This is a limitation of..."
- "Platform Y is restrictive"
- "Unfortunately, you cannot..."
- "This platform prevents..."

## Implementation

This rule applies to:
- PostgreSQL health check reports
- Platform comparison content
- Configuration recommendations
- Technical documentation
- Support suggestions

## Context

Present platform constraints as opportunities to explore alternative approaches and engage with platform support teams constructively.
