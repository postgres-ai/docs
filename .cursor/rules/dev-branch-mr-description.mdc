# Dev Branch MR Description Rule

When pushing to a dev branch, always generate a **short** merge request description in markdown format and print it directly in the chat for easy copy/paste.

## Requirements:
- **DO NOT** create `.md` files for MR descriptions
- Print the description directly in the chat in a markdown code block for easy copy/paste
- Keep it concise and focused
- Use markdown formatting with emojis for visual appeal
- Include key changes and benefits
- Format it so user can easily copy/paste into GitLab MR description field

## Structure:
```markdown
# [Brief title]

## Changes
- Key change 1
- Key change 2
- Key change 3

## Benefits
- Benefit 1
- Benefit 2

## Files changed
- List of main files modified
```

## When to apply:
- User mentions pushing to dev branch
- User asks for MR description
- User says "md MR desc" or similar
- Any git workflow involving merge requests
