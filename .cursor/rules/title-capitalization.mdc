# Title capitalization style

Use **sentence-style capitalization** for all titles and headings - only capitalize the first word and proper nouns (PostgreSQL, GitLab, DBLab Engine).

## Examples:
✅ "Database migration testing with DBLab Engine"
❌ "Database Migration Testing With DBLab Engine"

## Applies to:
Markdown headings, page titles, button text, documentation sections, blog posts.
